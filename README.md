# CIS1057
This repo was meant to help me synchronize files for Professor Raymond Lauff's CIS 1057 class, Computer Programming in C.
Please do not copy my work, however, if you're stuck then feel free to use this for ideas. Not all of it is perfect, so don't expect perfect solutions.
Also, if you do use this, just make sure to give credit in a comment somewhere :)
